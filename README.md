## 1: Understand Business Requirements

* Skill: Requirements Gathering and Analysis

Coding Application: Develop a web application that allows users to submit their business requirements through an online form. The application should have an intuitive interface for capturing various types of requirements, such as functional, non-functional, and technical specifications. Additionally, it should validate the input data to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## 2: System Design and Architecture

* Skill: System Design and Modeling

Coding Application: Create a software that can generate UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams based on the requirements gathered in the previous step. The application should allow users to input data related to entities, classes, relationships, and generate class diagrams, use case diagrams, and sequence diagrams.

## 3: Data Management

* Skill: Database Design and Management

Coding Application: Develop a database management system that enables users to define database schemas, tables, and relationships visually. The system should generate SQL scripts based on the defined schema and provide features like data querying, insertion, and modification.

## 4: Programming and Development

* Skill: Programming Languages and Development Environments

Coding Application: Create a version control system that facilitates collaborative coding among developers. The application should allow users to create branches, commit changes, and merge code changes securely. Implement features like code review and automated testing integration to ensure code quality.

## 5: Testing and Quality Assurance

* Skill: Testing Techniques and Tools

Coding Application: Build an automated testing framework that supports various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. Implement a test reporting system that provides clear feedback on the test results, including code coverage and test case execution status.

## 6: Implementation and Deployment

* Skill: Software Deployment and Configuration Management

Coding Application: Develop a deployment automation tool that facilitates the seamless deployment of applications to different environments. The tool should handle configuration management, rollback mechanisms, and ensure consistency across deployments.

## 7: Maintenance and Support

* Skill: Troubleshooting and Bug Fixing

Coding Application: Create a bug tracking and ticketing system that allows users to report issues, track their status, and assign them to appropriate developers. Implement a prioritization system to handle critical issues promptly.

## Step 8: Documentation and Communication

* Skill: Technical Writing and Communication

Coding Application: Build a collaborative documentation platform that enables team members to contribute to project documentation. The system should support versioning, searching, and easy sharing of technical documents and project artifacts.

## 9: Project Management

* Skill: Project Planning and Coordination

Coding Application: Develop a project management tool that helps in defining project milestones, assigning tasks, and tracking progress. Implement features like resource allocation, Gantt charts, and progress reporting to manage projects efficiently.
